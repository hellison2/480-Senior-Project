                    <p>
                        Lux is an alternative coffee shop and bar specializing in food, coffee, and light alcohol selections like wines and beers. The atmosphere is a new age, catering to young professionals and queer culture.
                        <br>
                        Many regulars participate in business meetings or friendly meetups. It’s a hotspot to come to study or work on a laptop.
                        <br>
                        The Wi-Fi works well and doesn’t even have a password, offering stable internet access. There are charging plugs littered throughout the cafe. The seating is vibrant and unique, with low-lighting and modern-looking features and architecture and wall art. 
                        <br>
                        There's a choice between couches, bar stools, and desks to work at. Lux also offers a lot of food and coffee options for everyone, and their baristas are inviting and calm. 
                        <br>
                        This cafe is kind of hidden; it doesn't have a strong outdoor appearance, and the entrance may be hard to find.

                    <dt>Coffee:</dt>
                    <dd>There are lots of drink options, and they always taste good. Not too sweet, not too bland, and not too jittery after.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Food:</dt>
                    <dd>Lux offers different food menus for different parts of the day. They have a wide selection constantly changing, and it can be confusing and frustrating if you get there too late for a specific menu.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Wifi:</dt>
                    <dd>There's no wifi password, and the connection is consistent and strong.</dd>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Seating:</dt>
                    <dd>There are awesome seats if you're able to find one. The cafe is very small, and since it's a busy shop, it can difficult to find a spot to sit. There is outdoor seating, but there aren't a lot of tables or desks where laptop work can be done. It may also be uncomfortable to sit outside on a hot day, as there's not a lot of shade in the outdoor section either.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Atmosphere & Aesthetic:</dt>
                    <dd>This cafe has a business-casual atmosphere. The vibe is very inviting and calm, yet focused.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Parking:</dt>
                    <dd>There is a small parking lot, it’s great if you can actually find a place to park, but if you can't, it becomes very difficult to find somewhere to park where you won't be towed.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Bathroom:</dt>
                    <dd>Lux has a single stall bathroom with lots of privacy. The restroom is clean and has traditional dive bar decorations and stickers.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Music:</dt>
                    <dd>The music is at a decent volume, a little on the louder side, but not enough to make it uncomfortable. They usually play indie, pop, and alternative music.</dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Creativity:</dt>
                    <dd>I think the owners of this cafe did a spectacular job decorating. The entire place feels very new-age and modern, and that vibe is especially present in the seating, where there are neon couches, next to funky lamps and lighting fixtures.</dd>
