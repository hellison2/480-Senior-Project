                <p>
                    The Best Coffee In Town was created to help students and remote workers find the best places in Phoenix to get some work done at! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are hundreds of cafes in the area, but between early closing times, limited seating, and the availability of wifi or food, it can be difficult to find the perfect cafe for all your needs, nevermind one that has the right atmosphere or outlets available to work at.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal of this website is to provide some fail-proof options to get high-quality lattes and focus on your work for as long as you wish, and of course, prioritize shops that are open late for fellow late risers.
