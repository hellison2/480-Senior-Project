                <p>
                    The Best Coffee In Town is on a mission to help people find high-quality coffee shops in the Phoenix metro area. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Platforms such as Google Maps and Yelp Reviews can be a great way to find some good shops in an area, but these listings are often inconsistent â€“ there's always missing information. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    One of the biggest problems I've run into as a latte lover who works remotely is not being able to find a cafe or coffee shop that offers good lattes, good seating, food, and is open well into the afternoon. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    That's where "The Best Coffee In Town" comes in. This website offers a small directory of 8 of the best coffee shops in and around Phoenix for remote work or studying. We include metrics like seating, wifi, bathrooms, hours, atmosphere, and menus. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    My main goal is to provide a list of coffee shops that cater to the working-from-home and studying crowd without being too loud or too intertwined with the college scene. I want to provide a small directory for you to browse through and really get a feel for each coffee shop before driving out. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    These reviews prioritize the atmosphere and logistics of working or studying there over the actual quality of the food or coffee. However, I can assure you that each selection was chosen with the quality of their food and drinks in mind. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    I have another priority on flexible hours. All too often I find that cafes close between 12p and 2p. As a certified night owl, that's just a little too late for me. All of the shops on my list are open into the afternoon; however, some shops have more flexibility than others. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    All reviews and photographs were taken by me specifically for this website.
